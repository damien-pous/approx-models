**A certificate-based approach to formally verified approximations**

This is a Coq library to verify rigorous approximations of univariate
functions on real numbers. Based on interval arithmetic, this library
also implements a technique of validation a posteriori based on the
Banach fixed-point theorem. We moreover provide an implementation of
verified Chebyshev approximations.
