**A certificate-based approach to formally verified approximations**

This is a Coq library to verify rigorous approximations of univariate
functions on real numbers. Based on interval arithmetic, this library
also implements a technique of validation a posteriori based on the
Banach fixed-point theorem. We moreover provide an implementation of
verified Chebyshev approximations.

**Axioms**

We do not introduce any axiom, but we need the ones used for Reals in Coquelicot:

ClassicalDedekindReals.sig_not_dec
ClassicalDedekindReals.sig_forall_dec
FunctionalExtensionality.functional_extensionality_dep
Classical_Prop.classic

Additionally, depending on the choice of interval implementation, axioms about machine 63 bits integers or primitive floating point numbers are used.
